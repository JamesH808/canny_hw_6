I got my code to produce images but when I compared them, they differed and I couldn't figure out what was wrong.
When opening my image it was similar to the correct one but had a few extra outlines. And when I ran the gprof,
I had all my modules except the kernel module, which I assumed was because it didn't take as much time compared to the other 
modules because it's not dealing directly with the image. The gprof showed that non_max and Blur_y specificaly take the most amount of time.
